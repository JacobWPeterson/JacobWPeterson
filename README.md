<br/>
I'm a software engineer specialising in frontend development. I have experience developing enterprise software in JavaScript/TypeScript with frameworks and libraries such as React, React Testing Library, Jest, Enzyme, Node, Storybooks, Loki, Cypress, and more.<br/><br/>

I earned a PhD from the University of Edinburgh where my doctoral thesis was on Gregory-Aland 1739—an important tenth century manuscript. I primarily publish on topics within papyrology, paratexts, and textual criticism. I previously worked for several years on the documentation and discovery of ancient manuscripts and led numerous digitisation projects throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia.<br/>
