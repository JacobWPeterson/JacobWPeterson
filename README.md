### Hi, I'm Jacob 👋
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/JacobWPeterson/JacobWPeterson/blob/main/globe.png" alt="Globe made of dots" width=350px height=350px/>
I'm a software engineer specializing in front end development. I have experience developing cloud-based enterprise software in JavaScript/TypeScript with frameworks and libraries such as React, RTL, Jest, Node, Storybooks, Loki, Cypress, and more.

Prior to software engineering, I earned a PhD in textual criticism and spent several years developing and overseeing projects to digitize ancient manuscripts in the US, Europe, and Asia.
