### Hi there, I'm Jacob 👋

I'm a full stack software engineer specializing in front-end development using Javascript-based technologies. I have experience developing apps with technologies such as React, Node, Express, Postgres, and more.

Prior to software engineering, I earned a PhD in textual criticism and spent several years developing and overseeing projects to digitize ancient manuscripts in the US, Europe, and Asia.
